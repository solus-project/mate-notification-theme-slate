mate-notification-theme-slate
=============================

A CSS-backed notification theme for the MATE Desktop.

### Arc Styling

The fallback styling for this plugin emulates the Arc-styled Budgie notifications. Style credit belongs solely with [horst3180](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) for his design work and the
implementation within [Budgie](https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-desktop).

### Themeable

This plugin supports CSS styling, and now has support within the [Adapta](https://github.com/adapta-project/adapta-gtk-theme) GTK theme, so
can be extended to suit any style.

mate-notification-theme-slate is a [Solus project](https://getsol.us/)
